</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Tech Radar Editor is a visual tool. You can use it to map your
    technology landscape. The map takes the form of a radar on which each blip represents
    a technology element of your team or organization.</p>
<p>For each blip you can place it according to 2 criteria: category and adoption level.
    The categories are "Languages &amp; framework", "Tools", "Platforms &amp; Data" and "Techniques".
    The adoption levels are "Adopt", "Trial", "Assess" and "Hold".</p>.
<p>For each blip you will also be able to indicate the evolution trend on the adoption part.</p>
