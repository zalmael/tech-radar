    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Tech Radar Editor is a visual tool. You can use it to map your
        technology landscape. The map takes the form of a radar on which each blip represents
        a technology element of your team or organization.</p>
    <p>For each blip you can place it according to 2 criteria: category and adoption level.
        The categories are "Languages &amp; framework", "Tools", "Platforms &amp; Data" and "Techniques".
        The adoption levels are "Adopt", "Trial", "Assess" and "Hold".</p>.
